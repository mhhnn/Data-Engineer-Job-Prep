| **1. Introduction to Sorting**                                              | Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order, usually in ascending or descending order. Sorting algorithms are crucial in computer science as they improve the efficiency of other algorithms that operate on sorted data. They can be applied to various data structures, including arrays, lists, and databases. Common applications include data presentation, search optimization, and statistical analysis. |
| **2. Basics of Asymptotic Analysis and Worst Case & Average Case Analysis** | Asymptotic analysis evaluates the performance of an algorithm as the input size grows. It provides a way to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time and space complexity. <br> **Worst Case Analysis:** Describes the maximum time taken by an algorithm for any input of size \( n \). <br> **Average Case Analysis:** Provides the expected time taken over all possible inputs of size \( n \). It's often more representative of practical performance. |
| **3. Different Sorting Algorithms and their Comparison**                    | There are several sorting algorithms, each with different characteristics: <br> - **Bubble Sort:** Simple but inefficient (O(n²) time complexity). <br> - **Selection Sort:** Also O(n²); not stable and inefficient on large lists. <br> - **Insertion Sort:** Efficient for small datasets; O(n²) in the worst case but O(n) for nearly sorted data. <br> - **Merge Sort:** O(n log n) and stable; uses divide-and-conquer. <br> - **Quick Sort:** O(n log n) on average, but O(n²) in the worst case; efficient for large datasets but not stable. <br> - **Heap Sort:** O(n log n) and not stable; uses a binary heap.  |
| **4. Algorithm Paradigms**                                                  | **Algorithm Paradigms** are general approaches for designing algorithms. Some common paradigms include: <br> - **Divide & Conquer:** Breaks the problem into smaller subproblems, solves each one independently, and combines their solutions (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort). <br> - **Decrease & Conquer:** Reduces the problem size by one or a constant amount and uses the solution to build a solution for the original problem (e.g., Insertion Sort). <br> - **Transform & Conquer:** Transforms the input into a more manageable form before solving (e.g., Binary Search). |
| **5. Presorting**                                                           | **Presorting** refers to the practice of sorting data before performing certain operations on it. This can be useful in scenarios where multiple queries need to be answered based on the same data. By presorting, subsequent operations (like searching) can be more efficient, particularly when the dataset is large and the operations are repetitive.                                             |
| **6. Extensions of Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort**                     | Each sorting algorithm can have extensions or variations to improve their functionality or efficiency: <br> - **Merge Sort Extensions:** Can be optimized for linked lists, which avoids the need for additional space. <br> - **Quick Sort Variations:** Randomized Quick Sort improves performance on average and avoids worst-case scenarios. <br> - **Heap Sort Extensions:** Can be applied to priority queues for dynamic sorting.                                   |
| **7. Common Sorting-related Coding Interview Problems**                     | Many coding interviews focus on sorting algorithms. Common problems include: <br> - Implementing a sorting algorithm from scratch (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort). <br> - Finding the k-th largest element in an array using Quick Select. <br> - Sorting a nearly sorted array (e.g., using Insertion Sort). <br> - Counting inversions in an array, which measures how far an array is from being sorted.                                    |
